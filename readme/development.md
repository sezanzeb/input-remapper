Development
===========

Contributions are very welcome, I will gladly review and discuss any merge requests.
If you have questions about the code and architecture, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper/issues).
This file should give an overview about some internals of input-remapper.

All pull requests will at some point require unittests (see below for more info).
The code coverage may only be improved, not decreased. It also has to be mostly
compliant with pylint.

Linting
-------

```bash
mypy inputremapper                  # find typing issues
black .                             # auto-format all code in-place
pip install pylint-pydantic --user  # https://github.com/fcfangcc/pylint-pydantic
pylint inputremapper                # get a code quality rating from pylint
```

Pylint gives lots of great advice on how to write better python code and even detects
errors. Mypy checks for typing errors. Use black to format it.

Automated tests
---------------

```bash
pip install coverage --user  # https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy
sudo pkill -f input-remapper
sudo pip install . && coverage run tests/test.py
coverage combine && coverage report -m
```

This assumes you are using your system's `pip`. If you are in a virtual env,
a `sudo pip install` is not recommened. See [Scripts](#scripts) for alternatives.

Single tests can be executed via `tests/test.py` using the full code path as argment.
```
python3 tests/test.py tests.unit.test_ipc.TestSocket.test_select
```

Also `python -m unittest` can be used, which provides more control over which tests to
run and how to fail on errors. See `python -m unittest -h` for more.
```
python -m unittest tests.unit.test_ipc.TestPipe -k "test_pipe" -f
```

Don't use your computer during integration tests to avoid interacting with the gui,
which might make tests fail.

There is also a "run configuration" for PyCharm called "All Tests" included.

To read events for manual testing, `evtest` is very helpful.
Add `-d` to `input-remapper-gtk` to get debug output.

Writing Tests
-------------

Tests are in https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper/tree/main/tests

https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper/blob/main/tests/test.py patches some modules
and runs tests. The tests need patches because every environment that runs them will be
different. By using patches they all look the same to the individual tests. Some
patches also allow to make some handy assertions, like the `write_history` of `UInput`.

Test files are usually named after the module they are in.

In the tearDown functions, usually one of `quick_cleanup` or `cleanup` should be called.
This avoids making a test fail that comes after your new test, because some state
variables might still be modified by yours.

Scripts
-------
To automate some of the development tasks, you can use the
[setup.sh](/scripts/setup.sh) script. The script avoids using `pip` for installation.
Instead, it uses either your local `python3` in your virtual env, or using
`/usr/bin/python3` explicitly. For more information run
```
scripts/setup.sh help
```

Advices
-------

Do not use GTKs `foreach` methods, because when the function fails it just freezes up
completely. Use `get_children()` and iterate over it with regular python `for` loops.
Use `gtk_iteration()` in tests when interacting with GTK methods to trigger events to
be emitted.

Releasing
---------

ssh/login into a debian/ubuntu environment

```bash
scripts/build.sh
```

This will generate `input-remapper/deb/input-remapper-2.0.0-rc.deb`

Badges
------

```bash
sudo pip install anybadge pylint
sudo pkill -f input-remapper
sudo pip install .
# the source path in .coveragerc might be incorrect for your system
./scripts/badges.sh
```

New badges, if needed, will be created in `readme/` and they just need to be commited.

Beware that coverage can suffer if old files reside in your python path. Remove the
build folder and reinstall it.

Translations
------------

To regenerate the `po/input-remapper.pot` file, run

```bash
xgettext -k --keyword=translatable --sort-output -o po/input-remapper.pot data/input-remapper.glade
xgettext --keyword=_ -L Python --sort-output -jo po/input-remapper.pot inputremapper/configs/mapping.py inputremapper/gui/*.py inputremapper/gui/components/*.py
```

This is the template file that you can copy to fill in the translations. Also create a
corresponding symlink, like `ln -s it_IT.po it.po`, because some environments expect
different names apparently. See https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper/tree/main/po
for examples.

Architecture
------------

There is a miro board describing input-remappers architecture:
