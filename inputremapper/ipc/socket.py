"""Non-blocking abstraction of unix domain sockets.

>>> server = Server('foo')
>>> client = Client('foo')

>>> server.send(1)
>>> client.poll()
>>> client.recv()

>>> client.send(2)
>>> server.poll()
>>> server.recv()

I seems harder to sniff on a socket than using pipes for other non-root
processes, but it doesn't guarantee security. As long as the GUI is open
and not running as root user, it is most likely possible to somehow log
keycodes by looking into the memory of the gui process (just like with most
other applications because they end up receiving keyboard input as well).
It still appears to be a bit overkill to use a socket considering pipes
are much easier to handle.
"""


# Issues:
# - Tests don't pass with Server and Client instead of Pipe for reader-client
#   and service communication or something
# - Had one case of a test that was blocking forever, seems very rare.
# - Hard to debug, generally very problematic compared to Pipes
# The tool works fine, it's just the tests. BrokenPipe errors reported
# by _Server all the time.
