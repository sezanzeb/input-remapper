"""Provides protocols for mapping handlers

*** The architecture behind mapping handlers ***

Handling an InputEvent is done in 3 steps:
 1. Input Event Handling
    A MappingHandler that does Input event handling receives Input Events directly
    from the EventReader.
    To do so it must implement the InputEventHandler protocol.
    An InputEventHandler may handle multiple events (InputEvent.type_and_code)

 2. Event Transformation
    The event gets transformed as described by the mapping.
    e.g.: combining multiple events to a single one
        transforming EV_ABS to EV_REL
        macros
        ...
    Multiple transformations may get chained

 3. Event Injection
    The transformed event gets injected to a global_uinput

MappingHandlers can implement one or more of these steps.

Overview of implemented handlers and the steps they implement:

Step 1:
 - HierarchyHandler

Step 1 and 2:
 - CombinationHandler
 - AbsToBtnHandler
 - RelToBtnHandler

Step 1, 2 and 3:
 - AbsToRelHandler
 - NullHandler

Step 2 and 3:
 - KeyHandler
 - MacroHandler
