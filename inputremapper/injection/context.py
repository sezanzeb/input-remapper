class Context:
    """Stores injection-process wide information.

    In some ways this is a wrapper for the mapping that derives some
    information that is specifically important to the injection.

    The information in the context does not change during the injection.

    One Context exists for each injection process, which is shared
    with all coroutines and used objects.

    Benefits of the context:
    - less redundant passing around of parameters
    - easier to add new process wide information without having to adjust
      all function calls in unittests
    - makes the injection class shorter and more specific to a certain task,
      which is actually spinning up the injection.

    mapping : Mapping
        The mapping that is the source of key_to_code and macros,
        only used to query config values.
    key_to_code : dict
        Mapping of ((type, code, value),) to linux-keycode
        or multiple of those like ((...), (...), ...) for combinations.
        Combinations need to be present in every possible valid ordering.
        e.g. shift + alt + a and alt + shift + a.
        This is needed to query keycodes more efficiently without having
        to search mapping each time.
    macros : dict
        Mapping of ((type, code, value),) to Macro objects.
        Combinations work similar as in key_to_code
    uinput : evdev.UInput
        Where to inject stuff to. This is an extra node in /dev so that
        existing capabilities won't clash.
        For example a gamepad can keep being a gamepad, while injected
        keycodes appear as keyboard input.
        This way the stylus buttons of a graphics tablet can also be mapped
        to keys, while the stylus keeps being a stylus.
        The main issue is, that the window manager handles events differently
        depending on the overall capabilities, and with EV_ABS capabilities
        keycodes are pretty much ignored and not written to the desktop.
        So this uinput should not have EV_ABS capabilities. Only EV_REL
        and EV_KEY is allowed.
